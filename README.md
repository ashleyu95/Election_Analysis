## Election Audit Summary

### This script can be used for any election with some modifications. Using similar formats as find the statistics for county and candidate, we can find the same statistics for other variables or even other information. We can apply this script not only with political elections, but also with other mediocre elections. For example, an election for the student council president in an university. We can change the different counties into different grade levels, as in freshmen/sophemore/junior/senior. We can keep the candidates part as it is. Another example that we can modify and use this script is the presidential election. This is a little similar to the county election that we have performed but need modifications. We can keep county, but we will need to add States for the electoral votes. We will also need to add a section for the two parties to help determine which party gets the electoral votes. This example may request a longer and more complicated modification.
